# AI Hardware Identifier

## 🚀 Overview
**AI Hardware Identifier** is an AI-powered tool that leverages Google's **Gemini API** to accurately recognize and classify PC hardware components from images and text descriptions. Whether you're scanning a motherboard, GPU, CPU, or any other PC component, this project helps identify, analyze, and retrieve relevant specifications with ease.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Upload an **image** or enter a **text description** of a PC component.
2. The **Gemini API** processes the input to identify the hardware type (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.).
3. The system retrieves detailed specifications, compatibility insights, and related data.

## 🔥 Features
- **AI-Powered Component Recognition**: Uses **Google's Gemini API** for image and text-based identification.
- **Multi-Input Support**: Accepts **image uploads** and **text descriptions**.
- **Detailed Hardware Insights**: Provides **specifications, compatibility info, and market availability**.
- **Automated Data Retrieval**: Fetches component details from sources like **PCPartPicker** or manufacturer databases.
- **Fast & Efficient**: Real-time component recognition with optimized performance.
- **Expandable & Customizable**: Easily extendable for more hardware categories and integrations.

## 💡 Why Use Gemini Hardware Identifier?
- **For PC Builders**: Identify components instantly and get recommended builds.
- **For Repair Technicians**: Quickly determine part compatibility and replacements.
- **For Enthusiasts & Resellers**: Fetch specifications and compare hardware without manual searches.
